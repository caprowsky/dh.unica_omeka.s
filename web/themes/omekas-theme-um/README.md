# Omeka S theme Maastricht University
Omeka S theme used at the [Digital Collections by University Library Maastricht](https://digitalcollections.library.maastrichtuniversity.nl).

This theme relies mainly on the schema.org vocabulary, following the guidelines of the dutch Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed (NDE).
This vocabulary is quite vast. 

In order to use, derive or co-develop this theme, it is highly recommended to also use the schema.org vocabulary and the resource templates 
that are developed in co√∂peration with the metadata specialists at Maastricht University. Use of this vocabulary tries to enhance good data exchange in 
the field of (digital) heritage collections and humanities and good indexing and crawlability in Google.
